# Azure-NHS-UK-Reference-Architecture-Study-Purpose-
This repository provides a recommended yet non-production reference Terraform project for a fictional, complex NHS-like application environment in Microsoft Azure, primarily for study purposes. It illustrates how one might structure Azure resources to meet stringent UK data residency requirements and follow Zero Trust principles, while implementing best practices in governance, security, monitoring, and compliance. This is not an official or production-ready architecture.


Overview
Multi-Region Deployment (UK South / UK West)

Emulates separate regions/trusts: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.
Implements disaster recovery strategies using primary and secondary regions.
Hub-Spoke Network Topology

Hub for shared services like Azure Firewall, Bastion, and external connectivity (ExpressRoute/VPN).
Spoke networks for each region/trust, enabling isolation and granular traffic control.
Security & Compliance

Zero Trust concept with Azure AD for identity management, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and MFA.
Azure Policy and (optionally) Azure Blueprints for governance and compliance enforcement.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel for real-time threat monitoring and SIEM.
Microsoft Purview for data governance and classification.
Compute & Application

Demonstrates usage of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service for front-end and backend APIs.
Azure API Management (APIM) for managing external and internal APIs.
Optional usage of Azure Front Door or Application Gateway (WAF) for load balancing and web traffic protection.
Data Layer

Azure SQL Managed Instance or Azure SQL Database.
Azure Storage (Blob/File) for object st

orage, with private endpoints.
Azure Key Vault for secret management with RBAC.
Monitoring & Logging

Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights for performance metrics and logs.
Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection and response.
Backup & Disaster Recovery

Azure Backup with Recovery Services Vault for backups.
Azure Site Recovery (ASR) for DR.
Infrastructure as Code

Terraform modules in a structured format for better reusability, readability, and version control.
Example usage of root main.tf, providers.tf, variables.tf, and modules for each domain (networking, compute, data, security, etc.).

Getting Started

Pre-requisites

Terraform v1.3+
Azure CLI or a configured Service Principal.
Properly created Management and Production Azure subscriptions or equivalent.
Clone this Repository

Configure Variables

Update variables.tf at the root level with your Tenant ID, Subscription IDs, region details, and default tagging policy.
(Optional) If using remote state in Azure Storage, update backend.tf.
Initialize, Plan, & Apply


terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

After confirming, resources will begin provisioning in Azure.

Post-Deployment

Review the output logs and note any created resources or potential errors.
Validate that the networking, security, and compute stacks meet your study needs.


Key Highlights
Scalable Network Model

Incorporates Hub-Spoke architecture with central egress, firewall, and bastion host.
Zero Trust Security Approach

Azure AD identity management.
Concepts for Just-In-Time (JIT) access via Privileged Identity Management.
Use of Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Private Endpoints to isolate traffic.
Automated Governance

Azure Policy and blueprint stubs are referenced for enforcing compliance and consistent provisioning.
Observability & Threat Detection

Centralized logging to Log Analytics, with optional SIEM features in Sentinel.
Application Insights for performance monitoring of microservices or web apps.
DR & Backup

Sample usage of Azure Backup / Recovery Services Vault.
Azure Site Recovery (ASR) placeholders for cross-region failover.


Important Notice
Non-Production Use: This reference architecture is for study purposes only. It should not be used as-is in any production environment.
Customization Required: Variables such as SKU sizes, naming conventions, region assignments, subscription IDs, and tenant IDs must be updated to match your environment.
No Official Endorsement: This architecture is fictional and does not represent official NHS policies or Microsoft guidance for real healthcare workloads. Always consult official documentation and compliance requirements when designing healthcare systems.
Security & Compliance: While the design attempts to reflect best practices, the actual security and compliance posture depends on your specific controls, operational processes, and regulatory environment.


Disclaimer
This project is entirely for demonstration and educational purposes.
No warranties or guarantees are implied. You are solely responsible for customizing and securing this deployment to meet your actual compliance and operational requirements. Always consult official Azure and NHS documentation for real-world architectures.
